## Important
If you download this app out of curiosity or to use for yourself, do not input any private information as it can possibly be leaked.
At the time of writing, there is a live server available for testing. If the app fails to load, this may have changed.

# Service
This app, at this stage, is no longer under priority level development.


## Description
Service is a tool and resources sharing app with the added ability to also share skills.
For a full rundown of the applications development and reasoning up till this point, read the attached pdf in the main directory.

## Visuals
Images can be found in the attached pdf report.

## Installation
To build and develop this application further, I would recommend the use of [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) in conjunction with the [Expo Go App](https://expo.dev/client) some dependencies are required.

Otherwise, there is an android apk that can be downloaded.

## Contributing
